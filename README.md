# Debugger for Abaqus user subroutines

 User subroutines are extremely powerful and flexible tools to extend the functionality of Abaqus solvers, commonly used by advanced Abaqus users. Debugging is an integral part of coding any procedures. For Abaqus user subroutines developing on Windows usually Microsoft Visual Studio is used to write and to debug user subroutines, although Notepad is theoretically enough to write a simple, several-line code. On Linux, the choice of development environment is not so obvious, and depends largely on the user's preferences and the programming project scale. Usually nobody uses e.g. Eclipse to write a short, simple code. The case is similar when choosing a debugger. Just as Vim or Emacs are good choices to write simple user subroutines, the GDB is a very common and powerful debugger. One of its main advantages is the access to it on any Linux distribution - it is installed by default with GNU compilers. So even if for many people its text interface is not very user friendly, for debugging relatively small Abaqus user subroutines it is really an excellent tool - as powerful on the one hand and as simple on the other as debugger should be.
